# DescriptionTemplatingSystem
A system for generating descriptions for products based off their technical specifications

This system is implemented as a series of libraries I developed as well as a Laravel Artisan command to act as the main method of the program. The system takes in two CSV files, one with cleaned specification values that can be used in a sentence and one with sentence templates that are ready to be populated with randomized word variations and specifcation values that are particular to that product. product specifications were generated by scripts developed from each product lines technical specification manual and stored in a database.

Most of the products handled in this project are either variable frequency drives or servomotors sold by allen-bradley.
